FieldWorks is the creative identity of me, Neil Jakeman, a Senior Research Software Analyst working in the Digital Humanities for the Faculty of Arts and Humanities at King's College London.

I've been developing digital research outputs for over a decade with global university partners in domains as diverse as medieval French literature and Bronze Age metallurgy. I lead many digital creative initiatives in the college and I lecture occasionally on the uses of GIS, VR and 3D tech in research.

I've also developed many web-based map resources and databases, both in academia and as an environmental consultant.

I have a rich set of technical and creative skills, and a broad network of collaborators.
