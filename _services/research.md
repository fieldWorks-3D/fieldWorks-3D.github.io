**Novel approaches for understanding art and recreating past environments**

During a recent collaboration with [Playlines](https://www.playlines.net/) and the [National Gallery X](https://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/whats-on/national-gallery-x), I used 3D modelling to recreate Titian's *Diane and Actaeon* in a virtual space. We did this so that the composition could be interrogated in a new way, enabling us to see directly the artistic license that the great master had taken with physical space.
