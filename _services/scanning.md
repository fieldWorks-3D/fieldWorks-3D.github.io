## Photogrammetry and LiDAR capture


<br />
#### Photogrammetry projects
<br />


I use a combination of software and techniques to get good quality scans at all all scales; from drone capture on buildings, to focus stacking on macro lenses for tiny objects. When the output is needed simply for fun, or time is severely limited, I occasionally use video capture and break the frames into a photo set for fast processing, as I have been doing with my personal _Thousand_ _Thresholds_ project. _Thousand_ _Thresholds_ is a collection of doorways, captured in passing with a very quick photogrammetry pass, whenever a door catches my eye.
