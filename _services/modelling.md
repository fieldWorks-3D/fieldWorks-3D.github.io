## Creating original 3D content

<br />


#### Kingston Magical Market
<br />
I was approached in late 2020 to help develop an AR treasure trail for [Kingston-upon-Thames](https://www.inkingston.co.uk/kingstonmagicalmarket) based on the idea that the market there had existed for many hundres of years and that in that time, all sorts of strange and wonderful characters had sold their wares. A competition was devised for local school children to invent a character and a story and the winning selections were recreated in 3D and animated. The 3D intepretations are accessible by using a mobile phone app to scan plaques in Kingston, which will trigger the appearance of the 3D character. It was great fun to work on, and animating some of the more bizarre traders was quite a challenge. We were careful to make sure that the charming naivety of the younger childrens' designs wasn't lost!
